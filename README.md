# Theory of Algorithms Programming Project (30%) 2018  

> Lecturer: Dr Ian McLoughlin  

### Breakdown of Project
This repository contains work on 10 exercises, completed from scratch in the [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) programming language. Permitted built in functions include `cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, map, =` and basic numerical operators `(+, -, *, /, modulo)`. Each problem is worth 3%.  

**Problem 1** - *Write a function in Racket that uses a brute-force algorithm that takes a single positive integer and returns true if the number is a prime and false otherwise.*
